  We use the tagging system from OEIS to decorate the sequences. We also use the
  description and the tags from OEIS for the sequences that appear in
  Sequencelib. The OEIS data is published under the [CC-BY-SA-4.0

  For the sequences in the folder
  [`Sequencelib/Synthetic`](https://github.com/provables/sequencelib/tree/main/Sequencelib/Synthetic)
  we used data from the [repository
  `oeis-synthesis`](https://github.com/barakeel/oeis-synthesis/), which is the
  companion for the paper "Learning Program Synthesis for Integer Sequences from
  Scratch". The respository `oeis-synthesis` is published under the [GPL-3.0
