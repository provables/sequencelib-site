  For the sequences in the folder
  [`Sequencelib/Synthetic`](https://github.com/provables/sequencelib/tree/main/Sequencelib/Synthetic)
  we used data from the [repository
  `oeis-synthesis`](https://github.com/barakeel/oeis-synthesis/), which is the
  companion for the paper "Learning Program Synthesis for Integer Sequences from
  Scratch". The respository `oeis-synthesis` is published under the [GPL-3.0

- We thank _Andrei Zabolotskii_ (from the [SeqFan mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/seqfan)) 
  for pointing to us that some formulas from the Synthetic folder were incorrect.
