A platform for formalizing sequences from The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).

This site contains the formalization in Lean 4 of a collection of sequences from
OEIS. It includes metaprogramming tools that index the sequences, display values
(example), and display equivalences among them (example).
