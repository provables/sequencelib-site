`Sequencelib` is a platform for formalizing sequences from 
[The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)](https://oeis.org) in 
[Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/).

We say that a given sequence (take [A000001](./A000/A000001) as an example) is
**formalized** when:

1. There is at least one definition in Lean 4 of a function with type `ℕ → ℕ` or `ℕ → ℤ` that
    represents the sequence as described in the OEIS entry.
2. There are theorems proving the initial values of the sequences.
3. In cases where there are more than one definition in Lean 4, there is also a 
    theorem stating that the functions coincide.
4. Optionally, there are theorems formalized in Lean 4 about properties of the sequences,
    preferably formalizations of the statements in the OEIS entry for the sequence.
